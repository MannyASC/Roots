    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hiking, like any sport, can be dangerous.

        As you prepare for your next hiking excursion, don't forget these two simple rules. <br>
    
1. Be Prepared

<br>2. Don't Panic
<br>

This first rule has two parts: <br>

Avoid danger
Be prepared in case of an emergency<br> <br>
Be aware of potential dangers that exist while hiking and know how best to avoid them. In addition, be preemptive and ready for an emergency before it happens--have an action plan.
<br> <br>
<span id='head'>The Four W's of Hiking Safety</span> <br> <br>
What dangers should you prepare for? Following are four potential dangers to be aware of when hiking.

        <h2>First W: Weather</h2>
        <p>Weather conditions can change rapidly and bring with them unique challenges when hiking, whether hot or cold, wet or dry. <br><br>


            <span id='head'>Be Prepared</span> <br><br>
            Check the current and future weather conditions before you plan your hike. Be aware of any possible rain, thunderstorms, snow, humidity, extreme heat, etc. and pack accordingly (or plan your hike for a different day with better conditions).
            
            Here are some suggestions for what to pack when the weather seems threatening:
            
            <br><br><span id='head'>For Rain</span> <br><br>
            
            Consider packing a plastic rain poncho (preferably one with a hood).
            
            Remember that people have died from hypothermia from wearing soaked clothing in the wilderness; choose to wear waterproof clothing to prevent this.
            
            <br><br> <span id='head'>For Snow</span><br><br>
            
            Bring extra clothing (large coat, gloves, warm hat, snow shoes).
            
            If you plan on hiking in the snow, learn to use an ice axe and crampons and be sure to pack them.
            
            <br><br><span id='head'>For Sun and Heat</span><br><br>
            
            Wear sunblock and a hat with a brim. Pack lots of water.
            
            <br><br> <span id='head'>  Don't Panic</span><br><br>
            Suddenly your pleasant hike takes a turn for the worse as the weather abruptly changes, what do you do? Don't panic!
            
            <br><br><span id='head'>Sudden Rain</span><br><br>
            
            Find high ground away from stream-beds and gullies to avoid flash floods. Stay on the trail, and find your way back as quickly as possible. However, if the rain is too thick to continue on the trail, take shelter under a hollow log or a rock overhang until the downpour lets up.
            
            <br><br><span id='head'>Sudden Thunderstorms</span><br><br>
            
            During a thunderstorm in the forest, the main danger is lightning. Avoid high, open areas--find a low area with a dense thicket of small trees. If you feel your hair begin to stand on end, lightning is about to strike--squat low to the ground, put your hands over your ears, and keep your head between your knees (minimize your contact with the ground, keep on your toes, and make yourself as small as possible).
            
            Also, be aware that lightning strikes can cause Wildfires (another of the Seven W's of Hiking Safety).
            
            <br><br> <span id='head'>Sudden Snow or Blizzards</span> <br><br>
            
            Try to reach a lower elevation, but only if you can do it safely. Avoid cliffs, drop-offs, and open saddles as both decreased visibility and increased wind make these areas extremely dangerous. Keep dry and stay warm (covering your mouth can protect your lungs from extreme cold).
            
            <br><br><span id='head'>Unexpected Heat or Humidity</span><br><br>
            
            Drink plenty of water! Signs that you are becoming dehydrated include:
            <br><br>
            -headaches <br>
            -muscle cramps<br>
            -blurred or snowy vision<br>
            -dizziness<br>
            -fainting<br>
            -decreased blood pressure <br><br>
            If you are experiencing these symptoms, your priority is water--find it and drink plenty of it (but be aware that water in the wilderness is another of the Seven W's of Hiking Safety). If you have access to electrolyte enhanced water, this can be even more effective than plain water in treating mild dehydration.</p>

        <h2>Second W: Watch Your Step</h2>
    
        <p>Unstable terrain has claimed the lives of even experienced hikers. Be careful of your footing especially near cliff edges and in icy conditions.
            <br><br><span id='head'>Be Prepared</span><br><br>
Be sure to research the trail you are planning to take. Does the trail have risky terrain?

Wear hiking boots with thick tread to help keep traction and not slip. Also, purchase and bring trekking poles (or a walking stick) to help with balance and relieve the pressure on your knees when hiking downhill.

Tell others where you are going and for how long so they can alert search and rescue if you do not return as planned. If at all possible, do not hike alone and stay together on the trail. Also, remember to pack a flashlight (or two) just in case darkness falls before you reach the end of the trail.

If you are planning on hiking in the snow, learn to use and pack an ice axe and crampons, and remember that sometimes north-facing gullies can still have ice long after the rest of the mountain is free of snow. And, last but not least, never enter an old mine shaft.

<br><br><span id='head'>Don't Panic</span><br><br>
While hiking, keep a lookout for posted signs that warn of unusually difficult terrain. Also, stay on the trail, and watch your step.

If you fall and are unable to move, signal for help. If you are hiking with a friend, send the friend for help or to find clear cell phone reception (many trails near towns have cell phone reception). The closer to town or the higher and more open the area, the better chance you have of finding reception.

If night comes, use a flashlight to find your way, or, alternatively, use a cell phone or backlit GPS as a form of light. Do not attempt to hike in pitch darkness.

        <h2>Third W: </h2>
        <p>When we step into the wild, we enter an enchanting world of intriguing plants and animals. Observe each with caution and respect, as some can be a threat to human health and safety.
        <br><br>    <span id='head'>Plants: Be Prepared</span><br> <br>
Bring a first-aid kit that includes bandages and disinfecting ointment. Thorny bushes and sharp branches can be plentiful. It's a good idea to wear long pants and learn how to identify the varieties of plants native to the area you are hiking.<br> <br>

<span id='head'>Don't Panic</span><br> <br>
Never eat berries or plants in the forest unless you have been thoroughly trained to identify them. For example, Poison-Oak can be of particular interest in certain areas. It has green or red leaves in clusters of three.

If you come in contact with Poison-Oak, wash the area of contact with soap and water immediately. A rash may develop within 24 hours after exposure. Antihistamines and anti-itch creams can help soothe the rash.

<br><br><span id='head'>Animals: Be Prepared</span><br><br>
Research and talk to local rangers about how to remain safe should you encounter wildlife, such as a black bear, rattlesnake, or mountain lion. Keep your food in a bear safe canister and wear a bear bell. Another good idea is to carry a Sawyer Extractor snakebite kit.

If taking children with you on a hike, advise them about dangerous animals and never let them wander off alone. Also, remember to wear bug spray to avoid bites and ticks.

<br><br><span id='head'>Don't Panic: What to do when you see a Black Bear</span><br><br>
Black bear attacks are extremely rare. If you see a black bear, stop, keep your distance, and let the bear pass. Never approach a bear cub or get between a mother bear and her cubs; a mother bear will defend her cubs ferociously if she thinks you are a threat.

If you are hiking with small children, pick them up and put them on your shoulders. If a bear approaches you, back away slowly (don't run, you can't outrun a bear), keep facing the bear but don't make direct eye contact. Also:
<br>
-Make noise and yell<br>
-Wave your arms<br>
-Make yourself look big<br>
-Throw rocks and sticks<br><br>
<span id='head'>Rattlesnake</span><br><br>

One of the most common venomous snakes in the United States is the rattlesnake. Rattlesnakes are extremely timid and like to avoid contact with people as much as possible.

Often, snakes will hide under logs, bushes, or in rock crevasses in order to avoid being stepped on. Don't depend on a rattlesnakes' rattle to warn you that it is near. Some rattlesnakes lose their rattles, so always watch where you step or put your hands, especially when crossing over a log or climbing over boulders. Tip: try to step on a log or boulder rather than over it.

If you are walking through brush or bushes, make a lot of noise to alert any snakes to your presence. If you see a snake, back away slowly and walk around it--the snake will not pursue you. If you are bitten by a snake, seek medical attention immediately. The California Poison Control System recommends using a Sawyer Extractor snakebite kit which has a syringe-like device to extract some of the venom.

Stay calm, try to keep the wound below your heart, and get to a hospital. Each year in California, only 1 to 2 out of 800 reported rattlesnake bites have been fatal.

<br><br><span id='head'>Mountain Lion</span><br><br>

The mountain lion is one of the rarest mammal to spot in the wild. They pose the greatest risk to petite women and small children. If you encounter a mountain lion, try not to bend over (but do put small children on your shoulders). Also:
<br>
-Do not turn away from the lion<br>
-Make yourself look big by waving your arms<br>
-Throw rocks and sticks<br>
-Speak slowly, loudly, and commandingly at the lion<br>
-Stand your ground<br>
-Never run<br>
-If the Mountain Lion attacks, fight back facing the lion and try to stay on your feet to protect your head and neck.<br>

<br><br><span id='head'>Scorpion</span><br><br>

Scorpions can be a nuisance, but their stings are no more serious than a bee sting. If camping and you leave your boots outside your tent, turn them over and shake them out just in case.

<br><br><span id='head'>Tick</span><br><br>

Another common insect found in the outdoors is the ticks. They drop down onto unsuspecting hikers and attach themselves to the skin. Some ticks carry disease such as Lyme disease. Most often, the tick must stay attached to a person for over 36 hours in order to transfer the disease, so check your skin for ticks after you hike and remove them if they are found.

        <h2>Fourth W: Water</h2>
        <p>
            Drinking water on a hike to stay hydrated is simply common sense.
            But there is a lot of nuance around how often to drink water on a hike, the best way to carry it, how to enhance it, and more.
            
            Let's take a look!
            
            
           <br><br><span id='head'>How often should you</span><br><br>
            drink water on a hike?
            It won't surprise you to learn that there are no hard and fast rules about when to take a water break on a hike.
            
            It's a matter of "it depends".
            
            The amount of hiking water you require depends upon:
            
            the weather conditions
            the activity level correlated to the terrain you're navigating
            the amount of weight you're carrying
            your size
            your fitness level
            That's why you need to create your own set of Hiking Water Best Practices.
            
            
            <br><br><span id='head'>Hiking water best practices</span><br><br>
            Having enough water in your body isn't just about stopping for water breaks.
            
            You can do yourself a huge favor by pre-hydrating: Drink up to a liter of water before you begin your hike.
            
            Your kidneys will call for frequent "pit stops", but it's worth it.
            You can also help your body post-hike by drinking a quart or two of water right after you take off your boots.
            
            <br><br><span id='head'>What about on the trail?</span><br><br>
            
            Staying well hydrated should be a simple matter of drinking when you feel thirsty, right?
            
            Wrong.
            
            Often, by the time you "feel" thirsty, you've already lost a lot of water via perspiration and respiration (open mouth breathing on an up-slope, for instance).
            
            Allowing yourself to become dehydrated is setting yourself up for hiking inflammation.
            
            
            <br><br>
            
            Which of these hikers is you?
            You stop regularly (say, every 45 minutes) to rehydrate during a hike, year round.
            You prefer to push on until you reach a destination: the lake, a summit, or your camp site for the night.
            Hikers who don't like to stop to rehydrate have a perfect solution: a hiking hydration backpack carrying a water reservoir (bladder).
            
            These systems carry additional responsibilities regarding cleanliness and maintenance, and can be pricey.
            And it's impossible to gauge how much water you're ingesting, so you might under-hydrate and set yourself up for a headache later.
            But what a convenient method for good hydration habits!
            <br><br><span id='head'>How much water to carry while hiking?</span><br><br>
        
            Here's my routine:
            
            On cool hikes, I bring a liter of water and might have some left at the end of the day.
            
            That's when pre-hydration and post-hydration habits help me stay "juicy".
            For warmer weather hikes, I carry at least two liters for a day hike if I'm hiking in an area without access to surface water.
            
            Bottom line: If there is plentiful water around, why carry it?
            
            You can purify your water when you need it, thus lightening your backpack.
            
           <br><br> <span id='head'>Water purification tips</span><br><br>
            You will need some sort of purification method when you're relying on surface water for hydration.</p>
